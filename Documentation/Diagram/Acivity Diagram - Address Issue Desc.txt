This Activity Diagram shows the Address the issues process. The actor that is involved in this process is the Quality Assurance Department. The Address the issues process will start by labeling the issues. The labels are good, repair, and replace. If the label is good, it means that there is no issue need to be addressed. If the label is repair, the Quality Assurance department will ask assistance from any department involved to that issue. If the label is replace, the Quality Assurance department will file a replacement report to the department involved to that issue. After filing the report to the concern department, the equipment will be replaced.
