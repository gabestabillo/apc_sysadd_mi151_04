                <h2>Project Context</h2>

                <p>The Inspection Application enables hoteliers to manage all inspections from a smartphone. Once the 
				inspection process is done, the app will automatically mail the data to the management. The Inspection 
				Application is important to easily conduct all the inspections rather than the traditional inspection 
				process that uses paper-based checklist. Inspection Application makes the inspection easier by generating 
				electronic check list in an organized manner. It also makes the inspection paper-less.</p>
